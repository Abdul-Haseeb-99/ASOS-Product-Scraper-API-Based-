# ASOS-Product-Scraper-API-Based-
This Python script extracts product data from ASOS using its internal search API. It handles pagination automatically, collects product ID, name, brand, price, and URL, and stores everything in a structured format. The data is then exported to an Excel file for easy analysis or further use.
